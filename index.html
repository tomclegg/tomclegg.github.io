			<h1>Not a song about Alan Turing</h1>
			<p>Alan Turing, a gay English man, invented programmable computers and wrote an essay
				about artificial intelligence: "Can machines think?" At the time,
				obviously not. But eventually the answer would be "maybe" and we would
				need a test. He proposed the Imitation Game. If a machine can play the
				Imitation Game and win as often as a human, we should say the machine
				shows intelligence.</p>
			<p>In the Imitation Game, a "judge" participant uses a chat program to
				have conversations with a number of "contestant" participants in
				another room. The contestant's task is to convince the judge that they
				are a woman. The judge must guess which contestants are women, and
				which are pretending to be women.
			</p>
			<p>If a machine can play the "contestant" role and fool the judge as
				often as a man can fool the judge, the machine should be considered
				intelligent.

			</p>
			<p>According to this test, we demonstrate intelligence by convincing
				other people that we are different than who we really are.
			</p>
			<h2>"The Imitation Game" failed the imitation game</h2>
			<p>In the film "The Imitation Game", the Alan Turing character describes
				a much less interesting game, in which the machine has to fool a human
				into thinking it's human. This game is unfair: the machine has to be good at imitating, but the human
				doesn't have to be good at anything.
			</p>
			<h2>Alan Turing didn't do well either</h2>
			<p>In the end, Alan Turing himself died young because he was not good
				enough at imitating a heterosexual man.
